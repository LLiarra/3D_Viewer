\maketitle
In this project we implemented a program to view 3D wireframe models (3D Viewer) in the C programming language. 
The models themselves loaded from .obj files and viewable on the screen with the ability to rotate, 
scale and translate.
A wireframe model is a model of an object in 3D graphics, 
which is a set of vertices and edges that defines the shape of the displayed polyhedral object in 
three-dimensional space.

The program provide the ability to:
Load a wireframe model from an obj file (vertices and surfaces list support only).
Translate the model by a given distance in relation to the X, Y, Z axes.
Rotate the model by a given angle relative to its X, Y, Z axes.
Scale the model by a given value.
The program  allow customizing the type of projection (parallel and central)
The program allow setting up the type (solid, dashed), color and thickness of the edges,
 display method (none, circle, square), color and size of the vertices
The program  allow choosing the background color
Settings be saved between program restarts
